Isograms

An isogram (also known as a "nonpattern word") is a logological term for a word or phrase without a repeating letter.

Isograms can be useful as keys in ciphers, since isogram sequences of the same length make for simple one-to-one mapping between the symbols.
Ten-letter isograms like PATHFINDER, DUMBWAITER, and BLACKHORSE are commonly used by salespeople of products,
where the retail price is typically negotiated, such as used cars, jewelry, or antiques.

For example, using the PATHFINDER cipher, P represents 1, A represents 2 and so on. 
The price tag for an item selling for $1200 may also bear the cryptic letters FRR, written on the back or bottom of the tag. 
A salesman familiar with the PATHFINDER cipher will know that the original cost of the item was $500.

Task
Complete the functions, in order to encode/decode the input numbers/codes with the provided isogram keys. 
Note: the key is case-insensitive (it may be upper- or lowercase).

For the input, you should accept numbers in integer or string format (encode function), or a string (decode function).

Return the result as an uppercase string.

If the provided input and/or key is incorrect, empty or missing, return 'Incorrect key or input!'

Examples:

 500,  "PATHFINDER"  -->  "FRR"
"500", "PATHFINDER"  -->  "FRR"
"FRR", "PATHFINDER"  -->  "500"
 500,  "PATHFIND"    -->  "Incorrect key or input!"
 500,  "PATHFINDEE"  -->  "Incorrect key or input!"
"LOL", "PATHFINDER"  -->  "Incorrect key or input!"

See some more examples in the sample tests (Link to Kata).
